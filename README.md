## react-custompropertypanecontrol

This project is the very first upgrade of a Webpart that comes from the Olivier Carpentier library.
https://oliviercc.github.io/sp-client-custom-fields/

It is useful for understanding how to use the power of SPFx WebPart property pane features.

Some components can be used easily in your project.
